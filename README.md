# Code for Timeline JS data extraction
These Python files were developed for the Linking Women's Pedagogy project at Fllorida State University by the Research Computing Center. 
An example of just 5 of the resulting timelines can be found at https://hernandezj1.github.io/LWP/
Please use the dropdown to observe! the final project will contain 268 timelines

### Processing description

#### Explodos.py 

This file is fairly brief and just divides the __Master Dataset__ into one file per pedagogue

#### creation.py 

This file converts each pedagogue file into the __Timeline JS template file__ so it can be accepted by the Timeline JS standards. In the future, it will be divided into a function module for imports and the actual processing which starts after the function definitions for now.
